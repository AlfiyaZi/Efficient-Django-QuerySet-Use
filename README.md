Efficient-Django-QuerySet-Use
=============================

Code and slides from [Jayson Falkner's](http://bitapocalypse.com/jayson/about/2013/07/17/jayson-falkner/) "Efficient Django QuerySet Use".

### Counsyl.objects.filter(django_queryset_type=EXAMPLES, helpful=True)<br/>(Helpful examples of Django QuerySet use at Counsyl)

This talk is about advanced use of Django's QuerySet API based on lessons learned at Counsyl. You'll learn how to debug, optimize and use the QuerySet API efficiently. The main examples focus on demystifying how QuerySet maps to SQL and how seemingly simple Python code, presumably fast O(1) queries, can result in unacceptably long runtime and often O(N) or worse queries. Solutions are provided for keeping your Python code simple and RDMS use performant.
